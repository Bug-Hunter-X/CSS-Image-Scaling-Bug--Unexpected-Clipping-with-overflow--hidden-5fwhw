The following corrected CSS code addresses the issue by using the `object-fit` property:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  height: 50%;
  overflow: hidden;
}

div img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

The `object-fit: cover;` property ensures that the image covers the entire container, maintaining its aspect ratio and preventing clipping.  Other values for `object-fit` offer different scaling behaviors as needed.
