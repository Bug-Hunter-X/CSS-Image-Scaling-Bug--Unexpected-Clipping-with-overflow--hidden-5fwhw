The following CSS code snippet causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  height: 50%;
  overflow: hidden;
}

div img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

This code intends to display an image within a div, scaling the image to fit the div while maintaining its aspect ratio. However, some browsers might interpret this incorrectly, leading to unexpected clipping or scaling issues.
